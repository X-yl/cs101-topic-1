              With the outbreak of COVID-19 there has been a sharp rise in digital threats online. Malicious agents are
              taking
              advantage of the situation by using the pandemic for their own benefit. There are multiple means they
              utilise,
              such
              as scams, disinformation and phishing. The best way to protect yourself from these attacks is by being
              informed on
              what they are and knowing how to avoid them. As a lot of people are now working from home, there are a
              record
              number of people using online services such as zoom. When online you must be aware of your data and
              privacy,
              services aren’t always secure, and your data could have been involved in a data breach.
              The areas we will be investigating are as follows:
            </p>

            <a class="article-heading" id="privacy"></a>
            <h4> Kyle Pereira – COVID 19 & Privacy</h4>
            <p>
              As technology evolves to deal with and work around the COVID-19 pandemic, it is ever important to
              scrutinize their impact on our ever-dwindling privacy.
              Contact tracing is a prime example of a technology that could be misused in a way which would reduce
              privacy. RAND Corporation finds that “there is considerable variance across programs” in their privacy
              analysis which charted 20 criteria across 40 programs in 20 countries.
              There are concerns that surveillance technology is being rolled out under the guise of COVID-19
              prevention. In Abu Dhabi, facial scanners meant to detect COVID-19 were deployed at border crossings,
              malls and other public locations have made data rights groups worried.
              Rushed adoption of new and existing technologies due to the pandemic is also a concern. One example
              is Zoom, which experienced a massive boost in popularity over the pandemic but has many privacy
              concerns. </p>

            <a class="article-heading" id="investment-scams"></a>
            <h4>Aaron Mclean – COVID-19 & “Investment Scams”</h4>
            <p>
              As the COVID-19 pandemic has had and still is having great effect on many aspects of our world, not
              least of which is the economy, which has seen moderate to severe decline in the past year. This has led
              to a large increase in investment scams. Investment scams are when people, through various methods,
              exploit people investing their money by either making think they are investing when they are just taking
              their money, or tricking them into investing into things that benefit the scammer.
              Investment scams mostly affect those who are less experienced with investing who can’t tell when
              something is fake or when it’s too good to be true. They can be done via fake websites, social media
              posts etc.
              They can be Avoided by making sure websites are secure via padlocks, don’t have spelling mistakes, the
              contact page is accurate, etc. Also, one of the best ways is common sense, the rule if it’s too good to be
              true, it probably is, is a good one to follow
            </p>
            <br>
            <a class="article-heading" id="disinfo"></a>
            <h4>Alastair McNeill – Disinformation / “Fake News”</h4>
            <p>
              Disinformation or “fake news” has a massive effect on our lives, it influences political beliefs, can
              platform harmful hate speech and lead to a distrust in the media. There can be multiple reasons why
              people originally share disinformation but it’s usually for political or commercial gain. Someone trying
              to
              create a fake narrative will often start promoting fake information by using bots. Once bots start to
              spread fake information people share the information on social media without thinking – continuing the
              spread of disinformation like a virus. Disinformation and fake news have existed long before COVID-19
              however during the pandemic the severity and consequence of the fake news has drastically increased.
              Fake news surrounding vaccines have had a direct effect on people’s health, such as the four-year-old
              girl who died from the coronavirus after her anti – vax mother contracted the virus. Conspiracies like
              anti vax gain their platform from fake news shared on social media, another example of this is the idea
              that China engineered the corona virus as a bioweapon which had over five million impressions on
              twitter from fake tweets.
              There are multiple ways in which you can protect yourself from fake information, a website extension
              such as health guard can flag websites known to contain false information. You should also keep an eye
              out on social media for posts which have been flagged by fact checkers to be false and generally be wary
              about information that you see on social media.</p>
            <br>
            <a class="article-heading" id="phishing"></a>
            <h4>Euan Gilmour - COVID-19 & Phishing</h4>
            <p>
              Coronavirus-related email phishing attacks saw a 600% increase in the first quarter of 2020. This kind of
              attack is particularly lucrative for scammers, as they have a success rate of 30% or higher, and only a
              small percentage of clicks are required to make financial gain. Thus, millions of emails were sent to
              victims of seeking to apply for funding relief provided by the government, their employers, banks, etc,
              often using coronavirus, or COVID-19 in the title to entice people. By referring to case studies of mass
              phishing over the course of the pandemic, I will analyse both the significant prevalence of this type of
              attack, and the increased sophistication of the methods used; as well as providing a guide as to how to
              avoid this type of scam.</p>

            <h4>
              Charlie McMichael – COVID 19 and staying home</h4>
            <p>
              Due to everyone being in lockdown the number of delivers to people’s homes skyrocketed as it
              was there only means of getting products, this resulted in scammers trying to take advantage of
              the situation by sending people text messages about delivery issue’s etc. I will be Creating a
              guide/informative page on what delivery scams are, what are the key indicators of the scam
              and how to notice them and how to try and prevent getting them/ how to report them. due of
              all the people having to spend time online for work, school, or entertainment it has caused a
              massive increase in internet traffic with some providers stating an increase of 60%, this resulted
              in many people experience bandwidth issues and greatly increased the risk of a successfully
              DDOS attack. Or resulted in many services having to reduce their overall quality like Netflix. As a
              individual there isn’t much risk of a DDOS attack but if you’re a small or large business owner
              you never know when someone might just come after your bandwidth</p>
