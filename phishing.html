            <h2>What is it:</h2>
            <p>
              “Phishing” is a type of cybercrime in which social engineering is used in order to deceive the victim into revealing sensitive information to the attacker, or unknowingly installing malicious software on the victim’s computer. Typically, this is done by sending a fraudulent message to the victim pertaining to be from a reputable organisation asking them to follow a link to a fraudulent website, often made to look indistinguishable from the organisation’s real website. The victim may then be asked either to download seemingly innocuous software which the attacker has unknowingly included malicious features in; or they may be prompted to input their login credentials, effectively handing them over to the attacker, who is able to see all user input on the fraudulent site.
            </p>
            <p>Phishing is a particularly troubling form of cybercrime. It is by far the most common, and this is likely because the fraudulent emails and messages can be sent out en masse to millions upon millions of users, yet the attacker needs only a small handful of them to be duped by the scam in order to make a very significant return. On top of this, it has been found that phishing scams already have a success rate of 30%. <a href="biblio.html#ncsc-2020">(Advisory: COVID-19 exploited by malicious cyber actors, 2020)</a></p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a lavish opportunity for scams and cybercrime of all kinds, and Phishing is no exception. In fact, both the most common and the most effective type of cyberattack over the course of the pandemic has been various kinds of phishing scams. With millions of people suddenly being put a situation where they needed to apply for funding relief programs, stimulus packages, and other forms of emergency aid from governments, employers, banks, and so on – often in situations of immense financial duress – the pandemic provided a lucrative chance for scammers to send counterfeit emails and text messages imitating these organisations, with prompts related to COVID-19 and coronavirus in order to entice people in potentially desperate situations. It is likely for this reason that a 600% increase in Coronavirus-related phishing scams was observed in the first quarter of 2020. <a href="biblio.html#pranggono-2021">(Pranggono and Arabo, 2021)</a></p>
            <p>Phishing is a form of attack that doesn’t just target individuals, but organisations as well. A prime example of this comes from Germany in June of 2020. The government of Germany had asked nine of its largest multinational firms to assist in the procurement of personal protective equipment in the wake of potential shortages. This initiated a widespread phishing campaign targeting high level executives in at least one, though perhaps more, of the firms in question. Emails were sent which directed the executives to fake Microsoft login pages which would steal their credentials.  It remains unclear if the phishing attempts were successful. <a href="biblio.html#lyngaas-2021b">(Lyngaas, 2021)</a></p>
            <p>Another example of an incident of COVID-19-related phishing comes from Taiwan in May of 2020. A hacker group known as ‘Vendetta’ sent emails purporting to be from Taiwan’s top infectious disease officials to a specific group of targets (when phishing is carried out in a targeted manner such as this, it is sometimes known as “spearphishing”). The emails urged the receiver to get tested for Coronavirus, and had an attachment containing remote hacking software that could steal login information. <a href="biblio.html#lyngaas-2021a">(Lyngaas, 2021)</a></p>

            <h2 id="about" class="article-heading">How to spot it:</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
             Phishing attacks can be easy to spot once one familiarises themselves with what to look for. The main foil to phishing attacks is that it is increasingly difficult to create a website and email template that is equally as sophisticated as that used by a professional organisation. However, it should be noted that there was an observable increase in the overall sophistication of phishing attacks since the pandemic. For example, one of the most commonly known ways of determining if a site was trustworthy or not was by checking if it was using a basic Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as opposed to the more secure HTTPS. However, it is estimated that around 75% of phishing sites are now equipped with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a cryptographic protocol that enables the site to use HTTPS, thus appearing more secure. Therefore it is more critical than ever to be vigilant when determining the trustworthiness of a given site or email. <a href="biblio.html#pranggono-2021">(Pranggono and Arabo, 2020)</a> </p>
            <p>The first thing that should be inspected when evaluating a suspicious email or website is the email address or domain name. The attacker cannot use exactly the same domain name or email address as the organisation they are imitating. Thus, upon comparing the two, differences should emerge. Often these differences are extremely subtle – a ‘0’ in place of an ‘O’, an ‘l’ in place of an ‘I’, an unassuming punctuation mark tucked inside a word, and so on.</p>
            <p>Another factor worth investigating is the grammar in the email or on the site. Often phishing sites and emails contain spelling or grammatical errors, along with obtuse language and peculiar wording due to poor translation. It is rare for a professional organisation to send an email containing such errors, and it is certainly rare for an organisation to host a website with such errors. Thus, if one sees this in an email or on a website, it is a cause for concern.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is worth noting that most phishing emails will try to discourage the reader from looking too closely at the email by creating a sense of urgency – an imminent fine, a threat to their personal information or account, and so on. Thus, if one receives an email with such an urgent tone, it warrants taking a moment to investigate further.</p>

            <h2 id="report">What you can do:</h2>

            <p>
             The most effective thing you can do to avoid becoming a victim of a phishing attack is to stay ware of how to spot one, as discussed above. Organisations should give their employees thorough training in the detection of phishing. If you receive a phishing email, it may be worth notifying the organisation that the attacker is imitating. Finally, it may be worthwhile to keep those less technologically inclined in your life aware when a particularly widespread attack is on the rise.
